Dear Friends,

 

Here is the code for the simulation of a moving bar which I talked about
during the meeting. This is an extension of the model Chou and I developed
by including spatial dimension.  You can see that the peak will move ahead
(14 lattice points or 10% of receptive field distance) of the stimulation
when v= 1.0. If you set v=0.0, you will recover with the famous center
surround receptive field. I am now using cone and horizontal cells. But it
could be bipolar and amacrine cell.

 

I think I will assign the development of this simulation model to David so
that he can use it to check the results of their OU experiments by using a
LPOU moving bar. Also, he can further make use of the different pathways of
the retina to construct realistic model. 

 

Best Regards

CKC
